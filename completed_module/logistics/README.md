The **How to Colab on Local Runtime** and **How to Move Colab to Jupyter** documents offer instructions that provide a backup to using Colab's "hosted runtime" option. These may be useful if Google updates Colab's packages to a state that is not reverse-compatible with the .ipynb code file. If you use this option, you should also use the .ipynb file included here which removes some packages that can only be accessed in the hosted environment: **DIFUSE_Astro_Colab_LOCAL_v_1_4.ipynb**.

The **UranusCalculationSolution** file provides example code that will return the mass of Uranus given a period, angular separation, and distance from the Earth to Uranus.
