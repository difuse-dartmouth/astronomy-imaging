The **How to Colab on Local Runtime** and **How to Move Colab to Jupyter** documents offer instructions that provide a backup to using Colab's "hosted runtime" option. These may be useful if Google updates Colab's packages to a state that is not reverse-compatible with the .ipynb code file.

The **UranusCalculationSolution** file provides example code that will return the mass of Uranus given a period, angular separation, and distance from the Earth to Uranus.
