# How to Download and Use the Colab File

This README contains instructions on two methods to download the Colab file in order to create your own copy in Google Drive. You must have a working google account with google drive to complete these steps. Do one of these steps to import the Colab file **DIFUSE_Astro_Imaging_Colab_v_1_4.ipynb** to your Drive. The other file **Astro-Imaging Colab Instructions** is a pdf that students can follow along with to help them use the Colab.

## Option 1: Import from Github

You can import a Colab file directly into Google Colab from its location in github through the file import features. 

1. *Set up Colab on Drive:* Go to your Google Drive, and under the "New" button in the top right, go to "More" and see if you find "Google Colaboratory" as an option. If you do, Colab is already enabled. If you don't, select "Connect more apps" and search for "Google Colaboratory" to add it as an option. 
2. *Create a blank Colab:* Once Colab is enabled, go to "New" --> "More" --> "Google Colaboratory" to create a new Colab file
3. *Import from Github:* In the Colab that opens, go to "File" --> "Upload Notebook" to open the upload menu. Go to the "GitHub" tab and search for the file in this repo using either the filepath or the direct file link. You may need to select "Include Private repos" to find the file. Once you find the file, select it to upload a copy to your Google Drive.
4. *You're Done!:* This upload will create a new Colab file in a top-level Drive folder called "Google Colaboratory." This new file is a working copy of the Colab! Share it with "view" permissions and update the links in the Canvas assignments to link to your new copy.

## Option 2: Import Raw Download

You can import a Colab file from a downloaded raw version into Google Colab through the file import features.

1. *Set up Colab on Drive:* Go to your Google Drive, and under the "New" button in the top right, go to "More" and see if you find "Google Colaboratory" as an option. If you do, Colab is already enabled. If you don't, select "Connect more apps" and search for "Google Colaboratory" to add it as an option. 
2. *Create a blank Colab:* Once Colab is enabled, go to "New" --> "More" --> "Google Colaboratory" to create a new Colab file
3. *Download from Github:* Select the Colab file in the DIFUSE repo and view it as a raw file. Right-click on the raw view and use "Save As.." to save the content of the page to your downloads or desktop.
4. *File Renaming:* The saved file may be a ".txt"; if so, the file needs to be changed to end in ".ipynb". Rename your downloaded file to end in .ipynb. On a Mac, you may need to right-click the file, select "Get Info," and rename the file under "Name & Extension."
5. *Import from Files:* Back to the Colab file you created, go to "File" --> "Upload Notebook" to open the upload menu. Go to the "Upload" tab, and select the .ipynb file from your files to upload a copy to your Google Drive.
6. *You're Done!:* This upload will create a new Colab file in a top-level Drive folder called "Google Colaboratory." This new file is a working copy of the Colab! Share it with "view" permissions and update the links in the Canvas assignments to link to your new copy.
